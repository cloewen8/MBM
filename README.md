# MBM
MBM (Minecraft Base Mod) is a collection of Java utility classes for creating mods.

## Motivation
I have 2 goals in mind for this:

- Heavily reduce maintenance time by reducing repetition.
- Simplify tasks to make developing mods easier.

# Tests
Due to the heavily coupled nature of Java, all
testing is done manually through [a mod](https://github.com/cloewen8/MBMTest).
